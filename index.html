<h3>Computer Science</h3>
<img width="20%" height="auto" src="images/Rhinopic.JPG" alt="Picture of Me">
<p>I am an enthusiastic programmer who is eager to learn but also has sufficient experience with front end and back end programming. Even though I have gained a lot of experience, 
    I am still looking to learn and grow as a programmer. I would love to be able to work with experienced people and grow from their knowledge in programming while also sharing mine.
     I am super passionate when it comes to programming and have released a fully developed game on steam called Creature Rumble. I have also made several prototype games and programs
      using C++, C#, Python, and a couple of websites in React and HTML in my own time (outside of work or classes). I one day hope to develop video games for both myself and big 
    companies. I enjoy coding a lot but also love the creative side of it when it comes to creating projects and other work.</p>
